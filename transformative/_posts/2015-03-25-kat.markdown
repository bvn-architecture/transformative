# Kat Martindale – BVN Research Director #

Dr Kat Martindale has been involved in built environment research for over 15 years as a researcher, writer, consultant and lecturer in architecture and urbanism. Originally educated as an architect (Plymouth), then urban designer (Oxford Brookes), and urban geographer (Oxford) before landing in Sydney to read for a PhD in planning policy, Kat has won nine international awards and scholarships for her work.

Working for academic institutions, private consultancies, think tanks and government offices has taken Kat around the world from the UK, to the US and Australia. This work has included land use policy, new town masterplans, city and town centre management, residential development policy, citizen engagement and participation, post occupancy evaluation and management, community development, heritage management, fuel poverty, environmental benchmarking, homelessness and housing for the elderly and disabled.

She is also a columnist for the Cities section of The Guardian, an Academician at the Academy of Urbanism (London) and is a member of the Planning Institute of Australia's International Committee.

Kat is charged with expanding BVN’s research capacity building on existing work and expertise and developing new streams that respond to issues affecting both architectural practice and the wider development industry.
