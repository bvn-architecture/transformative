There is no paradigm for a legal workplace, smart lawyers are agile and responsive to client’s demands and as the Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law* notes “we make life easy for our clients;  that’s our business”.   The design challenge is to provide the physical spaces that can improve the client experience whilst enabling lawyers to focus on the legal details required to discharge successful cases. Architecture like law is constrained by rules, using those rules to the best advantage is the purpose of design.
