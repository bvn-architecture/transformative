        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kat Martindale – BVN Research Director&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Kat Martindale has been involved in built environment research for over 15 years as a researcher, writer, consultant and lecturer in architecture and urbanism. Originally educated as an architect (Plymouth), then urban designer (Oxford Brookes), and urban geographer (Oxford) before landing in Sydney to read for a PhD in planning policy, Kat has won nine international awards and scholarships for her work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working for academic institutions, private consultancies, think tanks and government offices has taken Kat around the world from the UK, to the US and Australia. This work has included land use policy, new town masterplans, city and town centre management, residential development policy, citizen engagement and participation, post occupancy evaluation and management, community development, heritage management, fuel poverty, environmental benchmarking, homelessness and housing for the elderly and disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>McCarthy Tetrault</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;McCarthy Tetrault
This project came out of a visit to Sydney by Marc Andre Blanchard, CEO of McCarthy Tetrault where he attended a meeting in the new Herbert Smith Freehills office.  He remarked on the different spaces and configurations of areas and asked to meet with the Principal responsible for the design Bill Dowzer.  Following that meeting Tracie Cookes, COO of McCarthy Tetrault visited and asked BVN to submit a project for their expanding operation in Canada.
It was decided to develop a national strategy aimed at creating a new model for work based on five principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leadership –
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Defined by:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;future focused&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;sustainable&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;bold steps&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People –
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Defined by:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Needs based&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Health and well being&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Concierge model&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diversity –
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Defined by:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Choice&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Respecting the individual as part of the whole&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Appropriateness to place&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Synergy
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Defined by:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Physical connectivity&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Virtual connectivity&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commerciality
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Defined by:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;utilisation&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BVN has always used intensive briefing workshops to inform the development of workplace designs and so we ran a series of briefings and town hall sessions in all five Canadian offices; Vancouver, Quebec City, Toronto, Montreal and Calgary.  The resulting design is a legal team model that promotes osmotic learning and knowledge sharing by creating a series of harbours that really allow lawyer to lawyer interaction and easy communication with ancillary staff.
 To enable this high level of collaboration and community a highly flexible office module is used that is a 3m x 3m pavilion style, its sliding doors create complete acoustic privacy when closed , but when opened the corners of the office disappear into the wider workspace.  This pavilion is an important element in creating a transparent and visually connected workspace.
Equally important is providing really great quality communal facilities with a library, connecting stair and relaxing coffee bays. This fits in very well with the client model that McCarthy Tetrault have been evolving that is less formal and allows people to mingle.  It is based on food and an open servery bar that is replenished with fresh buffet food throughout the day and makes food a part of every meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* Team
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the team as a table&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Project Team&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ninotschka Titchkosky&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Project Principal&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Rod Allan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Project Director&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Kylie Barker&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Project Architect&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ninotschka Titchkosky&lt;/td&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Arup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ARUP – WORKPLACE AS WORKSHOP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BVN were commissioned to work with Arup to create a pilot project that would allow the people in Arup to experience and experiment with new types of spaces that would inform their future move to a new building.
BVN embraced the idea that an innovative engineering firm such as Arup needs more than just rectangular desks, computer screens and traditional meeting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BVN wanted to find a model of work spaces that are specific to Arup, that would also help encourage innovation and experimentation within the business and were better aligned with who they believe they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the design builds on feedback from staff about being able to have sit-stand desks, a greater variety of spaces as well as spaces which express both the Arup culture and the work and research done within the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design was developed in two parts.  The first part comprised of an ABW trial space for the consulting group which included work-points, collaborative spaces and lounges and a quiet workspace “the Den”. By selecting three different furniture suppliers ARUP were given the chance to trial and review different furniture settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Workshop – that was developed in collaboration with Koskela - included a variety of spaces,   such as informal and flexible collaboration spaces, social spaces and spaces devoted to knowledge sharing and research.  In addition the meeting spaces were designed to be radically reconfigurable using folding and sliding walls and a variety of flexible furniture that allows for all types of gatherings ranging from small meetings to ‘Town Hall’ events involving the entire firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Workshop recalibrates the notion of a place at the centre of everything by enabling ideas to be exchanged and objects to be tinkered with both digital and physical. This is aided by the location of the centre for knowledge sharing and research for Arup (Arup University) at the heart of this space, as an archetype of the future model, the workshop is a space which encourages people to collaborate, experiment, discuss, build, research and impart knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-architecture-of-asb-north-wharf&quot;&gt;The architecture of ASB North Wharf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASB is a quintessential Auckland and New Zealand company and it is essential that the architecture of the building speak of this building in its “place” – its physical place and its cultural place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior of North Wharf has been designed for function and with reference to the working waterfront of the Wynyard Quarter. Externally it reaches beyond its immediate context to find an appropriate endemic expression. New Zealand is a visceral natural country – its international symbolism is based on extraordinary landscape, of fresh air and of exotic nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal form of the building described by the fresh air pathway and the funnel is the major shape determinant of the external form. The internal tapering form of the funnel increases the airflow as the cross ventilation function takes effect. Coincidentally the form is an abstraction of a volcano, giving the name of Rangitoto to the level 7 boathouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Externally the functional roof of the building with its “cone” and ventilation louvres needs an associated, if abstract character to the façade of the building. The walls of the cone to the north and east are fully glazed to maximise the view from inside and to maximise the amount of sun into the building. However north facing walls also need sun protection – the vertical sun louvres are staggered across the façade in much the same way as both bark of trees is random and often vertical in nature; and the random striation of the louvres suggests the abstract forms of a rock wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fully glazed and transparent walls of Waikokota Lane provide a visual and material break with the long façade of the north. To counter the visually heavy expression of the cone and the metallic louvres a lighter façade has been designed, punctuated by three yellow ASB portals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pohutukawa tree is endemic to the north of the north island of New Zealand – it is a national and Auckland symbol. The north facade to the west of Waikokota Lane is designed as an abstraction of a Pohutukawa canopy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architectural design of the sunscreen takes the form of fallen Pohutukawa leaves as a starting point to explore a range of functions and sensations on the north façade. Firstly, the sunscreen needs to shade 60% of the façade to enable the fresh air and air conditioning systems to work in a sustainable manner; secondly, the major view from the building is to the north and hence any sunscreen had to be transparent to the view; and thirdly, character inside the building should elicit a condition of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process for designing the screen to achieve these three conditions was a collaboration between the architectural design team, the mechanical engineers, the façade designers, and the fabricators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting design is a cable net stretched across the facade. The original inspiration for this cable net was a yachting reference from the New Zealand rigging suppliers Ronstan – a stainless steel twisted wire held in tension across the front of the building – alluding to the tension inherent in the spar design of yachts under full sail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cable net has stainless steel connectors that fix bent aluminium blades – “leaves”, in different sizes and shapes based on a rectangle. The leaves are then punched with shapes based on the holes found in decaying Pohutukawa leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting screen casts shadows on the glazed façade so that from outside the building the façade appears to be a series of layered leaves reflecting itself in the glass of the façade. From internally the sun shining through the blades and emphasizing the punched holes appears as though a canopy of leaves encloses the building. The interior experience is akin to sitting inside a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun blades on the northeast together with the leaves on the north west of the north facade of the building are coloured in three variants of natural earth colours. For the blades the colours allude to the variants of bark, to the leaves they are varying stages of decomposition. The use of the same colours on the two disparate building elements ties the whole of the building together with the base panel colour of the remainder of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other elements of the building compositionally elaborate the broad cultural and landscape references of the design, especially the powerful public artwork by Michael Parekowhai, located in Waikokota Lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major compositional element of the building is the reflector, which sits upon the cone. The reflector has a functional purpose to reflect light down through the glass-roofed cone to enhance the daylight quality of the interior. But its emblematic quality is physical – to symbolize a “place” that marks the junction between land and sea, that points enigmatically to the sea and that expresses a dynamic spirit - not just of the community of people inside the building but a greater sense of dynamism between man and nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asb-north-wharf-and-the-public-realm&quot;&gt;ASB North Wharf and the public realm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defining characteristic of ASB North Wharf is its unparalleled commitment to the public realm. The development is located in the Wynyard Quarter, a new urban regeneration area for Auckland, fast becoming the new centre of Auckland. Its primary public space extends the Viaduct westward to the former Tank Farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urban master plan for the Wynyard Quarter calls for two lanes connecting the waterfront in a north south direction through the ASB North Wharf site. The North Wharf building respects these lanes and expands on their urban intention to produce a highly accessible public realm that transforms a hitherto opaque commercial precinct into a porous and connected 24-hour accessible public space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asb-north-wharf-workplace&quot;&gt;ASB North Wharf workplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workplace fit out is semlessly integrated with the base building, also designed by BVN, through Building Information Modelling (BIM).  Designed on Activities Based Working (ABW) principles, there are 84 work-points for every 100 staff, with a series of themes ‘neighbourhoods’ and major shared spaces for a variety of self-motivated work types – called ‘boathouses’.  The boathouses are inspired by local considerations and include” The City, The Deck, Rangitoto and The Containers.  These spaces are located on level 3 and level 7, either side of the neighbourhood floors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 1642 staff members are assigned to 16 ‘neighbourhoods’.  Each neighbourhood retains a unique identity through planning variations and colour schem.  Within the spaces are collaboration pods – rooms and furniture settings that repeat throughout the workplace, but take different positions and finishes in each neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The void shifts on each floorplate to reveal internal views, bring daylight deep within and to express structure and services. The overall workplace impression is of a dynamic and democratic environment with a strong sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Changes in the workplace</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A workplace that also transforms a city’s waterfront is a rarity.  The ASB North Wharf on Auckland’s harbor front is such a workplace and even rarer is its antecedence….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no paradigm for a legal workplace, smart lawyers are agile and responsive to client’s demands and as the Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law* notes “we make life easy for our clients;  that’s our business”.   The design challenge is to provide the physical spaces that can improve the client experience whilst enabling lawyers to focus on the legal details required to discharge successful cases. Architecture like law is constrained by rules, using those rules to the best advantage is the purpose of design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring the latest thinking on legal workplaces from the perspective of the Partner we talk to David Wilkie, Partner with Allen &amp;amp; Overy and Phillip Rossington Principal of BVN Donovan Hill and Peter Dunne, Partner with Herbert Smith Freehills in Sydney.  The changing legal workplace is discussed in a conversation between Bill Dowzer and Ninotschka Titchkosky, both Principals of BVN Donovan Hill, Ninotschka also give us some insights into a flexible design component that was developed to meet a legal practice’s changing needs.  Dr Donna Wheatley’s paper on “Social Centrality” arose from research into different workplace models.&lt;/p&gt;
